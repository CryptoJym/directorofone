## Core Features

### 1. Dashboard Overview (`/dashboard`)
The main dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the user's department status:

- **Welcome Header**: Personalized greeting with current date context
- **Key Metrics**: Four primary KPIs displayed prominently:
  - Tasks Completed (with trend indicator)
  - Hours Saved (efficiency metric)
  - Active Workflows (automation status)
  - Efficiency Score (overall performance)
- **Recent Tasks**: Quick view of latest tasks with inline status updates
- **Quick Actions**: One-click access to common operations:
  - Create Task
  - New Workflow
  - View Reports
  - Set Priority
- **AI Assistant Preview**: Contextual suggestions based on user patterns

### 2. Task Management (`/dashboard/tasks`)
Comprehensive task tracking and management system:

- **Task Statistics**: Real-time counts for total, pending, in-progress, and completed tasks
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter tasks by status (all, pending, in-progress, completed)
- **Smart Sorting**: Sort by priority or due date
- **Task Details**: Each task displays:
  - Title and description
  - Priority level (low, medium, high, urgent)
  - Current status
  - Due date
  - Tags for categorization
- **Inline Actions**: Check off completed tasks without navigation

### 3. Workflow Automation (`/dashboard/workflows`)
Visual workflow builder for process automation:

- **Workflow Types**: Three step types available:
  - **Triggers**: Events that start workflows (e.g., daily schedule, task creation)
  - **Actions**: Operations to perform (e.g., send email, create task)
  - **Conditions**: Logic branches (e.g., if priority is high)
- **Pre-built Templates**:
  - Daily Task Review
  - High Priority Alert
  - Weekly Report Generation
- **Visual Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating workflows
- **Active/Inactive Toggle**: Enable or disable workflows instantly
- **Workflow Statistics**: Track total workflows, active count, and automation metrics

### 4. Analytics & Insights (`/dashboard/analytics`)
Data-driven insights for performance optimization:

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Productivity Score (percentage with trend)
  - Tasks Completed (count with growth rate)
  - Average Time per Task (efficiency metric)
  - Focus Time (deep work hours)
- **Interactive Charts**:
  - **Bar Chart**: Tasks completed by day of week
  - **Line Chart**: Productivity trend over time
  - **Category Distribution**: Time spent by task category
- **Key Insights Panel**: AI-generated insights including:
  - Productivity trends
  - Peak performance times
  - Optimization suggestions
  - Strategic focus recommendations

### 5. Priority Management (`/dashboard/priorities`)
Eisenhower Matrix implementation for task prioritization:

- **Four Quadrants**:
  - **Do First (Red)**: Urgent & Important tasks
  - **Schedule (Blue)**: Important, Not Urgent tasks
  - **Delegate (Yellow)**: Urgent, Not Important tasks
  - **Later (Gray)**: Neither Urgent nor Important
- **Visual Organization**: Color-coded quadrants for quick scanning
- **Task Distribution**: Automatic categorization based on priority and urgency
- **Usage Guide**: Built-in instructions for effective prioritization

## Design Features

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent use of semantic colors
  - Primary: Blue (#4169E1) for main actions
  - Success: Green for positive trends
  - Warning: Yellow for caution items
  - Danger: Red for urgent items
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support with optimized contrast
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for all screen sizes

### User Experience
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for hover states and interactions
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and loading indicators
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus states
- **Contextual Help**: Inline tooltips and help text

## Sample Data & Demonstrations

All dashboard pages include realistic sample data to demonstrate functionality:
- Pre-populated tasks with various priorities and statuses
- Sample workflows showing different automation scenarios
- Analytics data showing positive trends
- Distributed tasks across priority matrix quadrants

## Navigation & Information Architecture

### Sidebar Navigation
- **Fixed Position**: Always accessible navigation
- **Active State Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for current page
- **Icon Support**: Visual icons for each section
- **User Profile**: Quick access to user settings

### Page Structure
- **Consistent Headers**: Page title and description on every page
- **Action Buttons**: Primary actions positioned top-right
- **Grid Layouts**: Responsive grids for optimal content display
- **Card-Based UI**: Information grouped in scannable cards

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real APIs for data persistence
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live data
3. **Advanced Analytics**: More chart types and custom date ranges
4. **Workflow Templates**: Expanded library of pre-built automations
5. **Collaboration Features**: Share tasks and workflows with team members
6. **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for on-the-go management
7. **AI Enhancements**: More sophisticated AI suggestions and automation

## Technical Implementation Notes

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
